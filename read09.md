# Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

<br>

## Functional programming (FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object-oriented programming, where application state is usually shared and colocated with methods in objects. (from medium.com )

## Pure functions are the atomic building blocks in functional programming. They are adored for their simplicity and testability (from freecodecamp.org)

## The function is pure when:
* ### when it doesn't cause side effects.
* ### returns the same result when given the same argument.
* ### when it doesn't read external files.
* ### when it doesn't relay on a random number generator.
