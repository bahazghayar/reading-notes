# **Comparison operators: Evaluating conditions**

### When you evaluate a condition by comparison operators the result will be a boolean which means true or false. 

#### **Comparison operators:**
  * #### == : is equal to 
  * #### != : is not equal to 
  * #### === : strict equal to
  * #### !== : strict not equal to 
  * #### > : greater than 
  * #### < : less than 
  * #### >= : greater than or equal to 
  * #### <= : less than or equal to 

# **Logical operators:**
### Allow you to compare more than one condition

 * #### && : and 
 * #### || : or 
 * #### ! : not 

# **Loops**

If you want a code to run 5 times, Is it logical to write the same code 5 times? No, so this is what loops for, the loop will iterate until the condition become false.

### Types of loops: 
1. For
2. while 
3. Do while
