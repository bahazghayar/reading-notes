#### Learning is just a decision you have to make and start your journey, I think most of it will be searching on Google, you can easily find everything about creating web pages on Google. 

#### In order to learn how to create web pages, you have to learn how to use HTML language to add paragraphs, lists, tables, images, and so on. Then you have to learn how to use CSS features to control the style and layout of web pages. 

### ***Different ways in which people access the web:***
* ##### Web Browsers such as *Safari*, and *Chrome*.
* ##### Web servers.
* ##### Devices such as *tablets* and *mobile phones*.
* ##### Screen readers.

#### All of the websites have been created by using ***HTML*** and ***CSS***, but larger websites also use programming languages such as ***Java***, and ***PHP***. 

#### When you want to visit a website, your browser will connect to a ***domain name system (DNS) server***, then you will be able to find the location of the web server that hosts that website. 

## ***How to make an attractive site:***

#### Organize your website's structure in **wireframe** and build your site, let your site be a perfect addition to the world. 

#### You will use ***HTML elements and tags*** to structure your site, also you need to keep yourself updated about new ***HTML5*** and ***CSS*** elements and features.

### ***Example of HTML code:*** 

            <!DOCTYPE html>       
                <html>
                    <head> 
                        <title>  Title goes here  </title> 
                        <meta name="description" content="An Essay on Installation Art"/>
                    </head> 
                    <body> 
                        <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
                        <p>This text might be an introduction to the rest of
                        the page. And if the page is a long one it might
                        be split up into several sub-headings.<p>
                        <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
                        <p>Many long articles have sub-headings so to help
                        you follow the structure of what is being written.
                        There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings).</p>
                        <h2>Another Sub-Heading</h2>
                        <p>Here you can see another sub-heading.</p>
                    </body>
                </html>

#### **Note:**
* ##### ***meta:*** contains information about the web page.
* ##### ***Doctypes*** tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.

#### We use in HTML those elements to describe the structure of web pages, and each one of the elements has an opening tag and a closing tag, such as:
>              <p> Hello </p>    

#### Also, we use attributes that give us more details about elements, each attribute has a name and a value, such as:
>          <p lang="en-us"> Hello </p> 

#### Each element can carry an ***ID attribute*** or a ***class attribute*** to identify particular elements. 

#### You can add ***comments*** that won't be visible to the users.
>           <!-- comment goes here -->

#### The ***new HTML5 elements*** allow you to divide the page into several parts such as ***headers***, ***footers***, and so on, it indicates the kind of content you will find in them. So it provides a clearer code than the traditional HTML layouts. You need to help older browsers that do not understand HTML5 elements by telling them which elements are ***block-level elements***.

#### Literally, you need to know almost everything about your target audience and companies, you need to put yourself in their shoes and think about what you should do to make your site better and better and what your visitors need, or maybe they are looking for specific things, maybe entertainments or information, you need to help them quickly and effectively. Use site maps to plan the structure and wireframes to organize the information on each page in a good visual hierarchy.


         
# ***Programming with JavaScript***

#### First of all, you need to understand programming concepts and that computers use data to create models of the world, then you need to learn the syntax of the programming language, then you should see more examples to look at how the programming language will be applied on browsers. Also, you need some experience in HTML and CSS.

#### JavaScript allows you to make websites more interactive by writing a code containing a set of steps.

#### **So the ABC of programming:**
* ##### what is the script and how to make one?
* ##### How do computers work and fit with the world?
* ##### How to write a script for a web page? 

#### Computers follow a series of instructions step by step that wrote by a programmer to achieve his aim, that what we call a script, so you need to make a goal then think step by step in order to make a script, a ***flowchart*** will help you a lot.

## ***How do you write a script for a web page by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?***

#### Remember that HTML and CSS are not programming languages, but both of them fit with JavaScript for making the structure and the styles of your web pages. You can write JavaScript in plain text just like CSS and HTML.

#### A ***script*** is made from a lot of statements, it contains instructions from the programmer, and you will use variables to store information used in the syntax.

#### Method of an object:  
>                Document.write(‘Hello’);

* ##### Document is an object.
* ##### The dot (.) is a member operator.
* ##### write.(‘Hello’) is a method.
* ##### ‘Hello’ is a parameter.

#### ***script***: it used to load the JavaScript file in HTML pages
#### ***link***: it used to load a CSS file
