# Graphs

**Graph** is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting them. A pair (x,y) is referred to as an edge, which communicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex. In the examples below, circles represent vertices, while lines represent edges.

**Advantages of Graph**:
* Graph can be created proportionally to the quantity it needs to represent.
* Displays multiple classes of data in one chart.
* Puts large sums of data into visual form for easy understanding.
* More visually appealing than other graphs.
* Offers easy calculations of data accuracy.
* Requires little explanation.

**Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected**
A complete graph is when all nodes are connected to all other nodes.
A connected graph is graph that has all of `vertices/nodes` have at least one edge.
A disconnected graph is a graph where some vertices may not have edges.
