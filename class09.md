# OAuth

## OAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them the passwords.This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon,Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites.

## Features of OAuth
* ### OAuth 2.0 is a simple protocol that allows to access resources of the user without sharing passwords.
* ### It provides user agent flows for running clients application using a scripting language, such as JavaScript. Typically, a browser is a user agent.
* ### It accesses the data using tokens instead of using their credentials and stores data in online file system of the user such as Google Docs or Dropbox account.

## Advantages of OAuth
* ### it's very flexible protocol that relies on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer that ensures data between the web server and browsers remain private) to save user access token.
* ### it relies on SSL which is used to ensure cryptography industry protocols and are being used to keep the data safe.
* ### It allows limited access to the user's data and allows accessing when authorization tokens expire.
* ### It has ability to share data for users without having to release personal information.
* ### It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication.

## The difference between OAuth1 and OAuth2
## OAuth 2.0 is much more usable, but much more difficult to build securely. Much more flexible. OAuth 1.0 only handled web workflows, but OAuth 2.0 considers non-web clients as well. Better separation of duties.
