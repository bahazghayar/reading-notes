# SQL (Structured Query Language)

<br>

### **SQL**: is a *domain-specific language* used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system **(RDBMS)**, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system **(RDSMS)**. It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables. (from Wikipedia )

### SQL offers two main advantages over older readâ€“write APIs such as ISAM or VSAM. Firstly, it introduced the concept of accessing many records with one single command. Secondly, it eliminates the need to specify how to reach a record, e.g. with or without an index. (from Wikipedia)

## SQL databases:
* ### SQLite.
* ### MySQL.
* ### Postgres.
* ### Oracle.
* ### Microsoft SQL.
