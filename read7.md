# Programming with JavaScript 

First of all, you need to understand programming concepts, then you need to learn the syntax of the programming language, then you should see more examples to look at how the programming language will be applied on browsers. Also, you need some experience in HTML and CSS.

JavaScript allows you to make websites more interactive by writing a code containing a set of steps.

## So the **ABC of programming** : 
   * what is the script and how to make one?
   * How do computers work and fit with the world? 
   * How to write a script for a web page? 

Computers follow a series of instructions step by step that wrote by a programmer to achieve his aim, that what we call a **script**, so you need to make a goal then think step by step in order to make a script, a **flowchart** will help you a lot.  

## Expressions 

Every expression has a value, but you need to assign that value to a variable by using operators like arithmetic operators and string operator. 

## Functions 

Functions are what will make your programming journey easier, you don't have to repeat the same task every time when you need it, simply use **Functions**, so declare a function first then call it when you need it.
