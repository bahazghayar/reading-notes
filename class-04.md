# **Links**

Links allow you to move from a web page to another one for browsing. We use `<a>` to create a link, and we use **href** attribute to indicate which page you want to.

**Example:**
`<a href="http://www.imdb.com">IMDB</a>`

**Types of links:**
* Link to another website. 
* Link to other web pages on the same site. (Tip: use relative links ) 
* Email links. 
* A new window opening links. 
* Link to a specific part on the same page. 
* Link to a specific part on other web page.


# Layout 

Each **HTML element** has its own box from CSS perspective, this box will be a *block-level box* or an *inline box*, and you can control the **dimensions**, **borders**, **margin**, and **padding** of any box. Also, you can modify the colors for any element. You can include multiple CSS files on one page. 

#### If any block-level element sits inside another one, the outer one known as the containing or parent element, usually `<div>` elements are used as containing elements 

**positioning schemes:**
* Normal flow.
* Relative positioning.
* Absolute positioning.
* Fixed positioning. 
* Floating elements. 

If you didn't specify **relative**, **absolute**, or **fixed positioning** the browsers will display web pages in the normal flow.

# Functions

Functions are what will make your programming journey easier, you don't have to repeat the same task every time when you need it, simply use **Functions**, so declare a function first then call it (can take parameters) when you need it, and may return a value. 

**Example:**
    *Declaring:*   
                  function Hello ( ) {
                  document.write ('Hello') ; 
                   }
    *calling a function:*
                  Hello ( ) ;

# **Pair Programming** 

You can *improve your code*, *review it*, and *check errors instantaneously line by line* with pair programming, it involves **the driver** (the programmer who writes the code and handle the text editor and version control ) and **the navigator** ( he thinks about the big picture and guide the driver but doesn't provide direct inputs, and he doesn't write any code )

**In pair programming, you will work on language-specific skills:**
1. Speaking: explaining the code 
2. Listening: listen to other guidance
3. Reading 
4. Writing: write the code
