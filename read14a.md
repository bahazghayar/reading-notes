# **Database Normalization** 

## *Database normalization* is the process of structuring a database, usually a relational database, in accordance with a series of so-called normal forms in order to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. It was first proposed by Edgar F. Codd as part of his relational model. *(from Wikipedia)*

## Normalization entails organizing the columns *(attributes)* and tables *(relations)* of a database to ensure that their dependencies are properly enforced by database integrity constraints. It is accomplished by applying some formal rules either by a process of synthesis *(creating a new database design)* or decomposition *(improving an existing database design)*. *(from Wikipedia)*

## Reasons for Database Normalization: 
### 1. Minimize duplicate data.
### 2. Minimize or avoid data modification issues.
### 3. Simplify queries.
