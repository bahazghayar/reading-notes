How do you write a script for a web page by using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? 
Remember that HTML and CSS are not programming languages, but both of them fit with JavaScript for making the structure and the styles of your web pages. You can write JavaScript in plain text just like CSS and HTML. 

A script is made from a lot of statements, it contains instructions from the programmer, and you will use variables to store information used in the syntax. 

Method of an object:   Document.write('Hello');  

  * Document is an object 
  * The dot (.) is an member operator 
  * write.('Hello') is a method 
  * 'Hello' is a parameter
