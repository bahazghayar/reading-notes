# ***Layout***

Each **HTML element** has its own box from *CSS perspective*, this box will be a *block-level box* or an *inline box*, and you can control the **dimensions**, **borders**, **margin**, and **padding** of any box. Also, you can modify the colors for any element. You can include multiple CSS files on one page. 

#### If any block-level element sits inside another one, the outer one known as the containing or parent element, usually `<div>` elements are used as containing elements 

**positioning schemes:**
* Normal flow.
* Relative positioning.
* Absolute positioning.
* Fixed positioning. 
* Floating elements. 

If you didn't specify **relative**, **absolute**, or **fixed positioning** the browsers will display web pages in the normal flow.

You can `float` to move the content to the **right** or **left** of the web page, and the page can be **fixed-width** or **liquid layouts**. Also, you can include multiple CSS files.
