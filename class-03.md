# **Lists**

#### Types of lists in HTML: 
* ##### Ordered: `<ol>` with `<li>`
* ##### Unordered: `<ul> ` with `<li>`
* ##### Definition: `<dl> `,  `<dt>`   ,  `<dd>` 

#### **Ordered lists** use *numbers*, and **unordered lists** use *bullets*, and **definition lists** are used to *define terminology*. 

#### **Nested lists**: you can make lists nested inside one another.

# **Boxes**

#### Each HTML element has its own box from CSS perspective, and you can control the dimensions, borders, margin, and padding of any box. Also, you can modify the colors for any element. 

#### You can *hide elements* by using the *display* and *visibility properties*.

#### Example: 
              p {
                  border: 5px solid #cccccc;
                  padding: 20px;
                  width: 275px;
                  text-align: center;
                  border-radius: 10px;
                  -moz-border-radius: 10px;
                  -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
                  }

#### You can create image borders and rounded borders with CSSS3.

# **JavaScript**

#### If you want to store a list of values you have to use ***arrays***, you can access its values and change them.

# **Loops**

#### If you want a code to run 5 times, Is it logical to write the same code 5 times? No, so this is what loops for, the loop will iterate until the condition become false.

#### Types of loops:  all of them repeats a set of statments.
1. ##### For
2. ##### while 
3. ##### Do while

#### If you want to compare values against outcomes you should use switch statements, and it also provides an option if no one match.

#### Example: 
             switch (level) {
                     case 1:
                     msg = 'Good luck on the first test ' ;
                     break;
                     case 2:
                     msg = 'Second of three - keep going!';
                     break;
                     case 3:
                     msg = ' Final round, almost there!';
                     break;
                     default :
                     msg = 'Good luck!';
                     break;
                             }
