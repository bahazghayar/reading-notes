# **Growth mindset**
## *be ready to change your way of thinking* :EMOJICODE:

#### The question is how can you live without a growth mindset? 
#### I bet that your life is so boring without goals, challenges, and achievements. 
#### All of us need to make our own growth mindset, put goals, challenge ourselves, maybe you won't achieve all of your goals, but you will be so happy and satisfied with the goals you had achieved. 
#### Don't say I am not smart or I don't have a talent, this is the easy thing to do, be insist on improving yourself and keep trying, trust me it will pay off somehow. 

#### I will tell you some differences between growth and a fixed mindset, and you decide which one you want to be. 

- Growth mindset 
    1. Embraces challenges 
    2. Inspires by success of others  
    3. Learns from criticism 
    
- Fixed mindset 
    1. Avoids challenges 
    2. View success of others as a threat 
    3. Ignores criticims 
    

### So now its obvious which one you want to be, success is not easy at all. 

#### you need to put effort to face your challenges and obstacles, then every day ask yourself what you have learned on that day, which problems you faced could solve better.

### Make a table about what you have to do each day and tick what you have done when you did it 

  - [x] Pray, Eat my breakfast 
  - [x] Do ASAC assignments 
  - [ ] Do workouts 

#### I always remind myself to be in a growth mindset by writing every motivational ideas and sentence in my notes and on my room's wall like NO PAIN NO GAIN,  working hard will always pay off, and fly above the negativity.
