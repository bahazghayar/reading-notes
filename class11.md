# Event Driven Applications

## Why is access control important?
### because it is a valuable security technique that can be used to regulate who or what can view or use any given resource. ... Without proper access control you could leave your staff and your company wide open to problems such as data loss, theft or breach of privacy and data protection laws.

## Describe an application that would need access control.
### Any application that has data and doesn't allowed anyone to edit the data or delete it maybe.

## What is a role used for?
### policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges

## Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
### Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC lets employees have access rights only to the information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

### discretionary access control (DAC) is a type of access control defined by the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria "as a means of restricting access to objects based on the identity of subjects and/or groups to which they belong. The controls are discretionary in the sense that a subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that permission (perhaps indirectly) on to any other subject (unless restrained by mandatory access control)".

### mandatory access control (MAC) refers to a type of access control by which the operating system or database constrains the ability of a subject or initiator to access or generally perform some sort of operation on an object or target.

## Term

### Authorization: is a security mechanism to determine access levels or user/client privileges related to system resources including files, services, computer programs, data and application features. This is the process of granting or denying access to a network resource which allows the user access to various resources based on the user's identity.

### Role Based Access Control:(RBAC) is a method of restricting network access based on the roles of individual users within an enterprise. RBAC lets employees have access rights only to the information they need to do their jobs and prevents them from accessing information that doesn't pertain to them.

### Capabilities: is a concept in the design of secure computing systems, one of the existing security models. A capability (known in some systems as a key) is a communicable, unforgeable token of authority. It refers to a value that references an object along with an associated set of access rights. A user program on a capability-based operating system must use a capability to access an object.

## Preview

### Event-driven programming is a programming paradigm in which the flow of the program is determined by events such as user actions (mouse clicks, key presses), sensor outputs, or message passing from other programs or threads. Event-driven programming is the dominant paradigm used in graphical user interfaces and other applications (e.g., JavaScript web applications) that are centered on performing certain actions in response to user input. This is also true of programming for device drivers.

### Common uses:
### Most existing GUI development tools and architectures rely on event-driven programming. The Java AWT framework processes all UI changes on a single thread, called the Event dispatching thread. Similarly, all UI updates in the Java framework JavaFX occur on the JavaFX Application Thread.
### In addition, systems such as Node.js are also event-driven.
