# **Data Modeling**

# Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
### 1. Better program design and higher code quality.
### 2. Detailed project documentation.
### 3. TDD reduces the time required for project development.

# In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
### beforeEach() is run before each test in a describe.
### afterEach()  is run after each test in a describe.

# What is one downside of Test Driven Development
### The downside to TDD is that it is usually tightly associated with 'Agile' methodology, which places no importance on documentation of a system, rather the understanding behind why a test 'should' return one specific value rather than any other resides only in the developer's head.

# What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
### Classes inherit from classes and create subclass relationships: hierarchical class taxonomies.
### Prototypal Inheritance: A prototype is a working object instance. Objects inherit directly from other objects.
### A prototype is a working object instance. Objects inherit directly from other objects.
### Class inheritance creates parent/child object taxonomies as a side-effect.

# Why REST?
### REST is much easier than other approaches such as SOAP which keeps developers from having to reinvent the wheel as far as HTTP request operations go. SOAP also requires separate server and client programs.
### Since REST is based on standard HTTP operations, it uses verbs with specific meanings such as "get" or "delete" which avoids ambiguity. Resources are assigned individual URIs, adding flexibility.
### With REST, information that is produced and consumed is separated from the technologies that facilitate production and consumption. As a result, REST performs well, is highly scalable, simple, and easy to modify and extend.

# Document the following Vocabulary Terms:

## functional programming:
#### (often abbreviated FP) is the process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data, and side-effects. Functional programming is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions.
from (medium.com)

## object-oriented programming (OOP):
#### (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. The organization of an object-oriented program also makes the method beneficial to collaborative development, where projects are divided into groups.
from (searchapparchitecture.techtarget.com)

## class:
#### is an extensible program-code-template for creating objects, providing initial values for state (member variables) and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods). In these languages, a class that creates classes is called a metaclass.
from (Wikipedia)

## super: By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods
from (www.w3schools.com)

## this:
#### A property of an execution context (global, function or eval) that, in non–strict mode, is always a reference to an object and in strict mode can be any value.
from (developer.mozilla.org)

## Test Driven Development (TDD):
#### is a software development practice enabling developers to create proper specifications about how their code should be written and implemented. Fundamentally, TDD is a practice when a programmer writes a functional test before building a code.

## Jest:
#### is a JavaScript testing framework maintained by Facebook, Inc. designed and built by Christoph Nakazawa with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. It works with projects using Babel, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Angular, Vue.js and Svelte. Jest does not require a lot of configuration for first time users of a testing framework.

## Continuous Integration (CI):
#### is the practice of merging all developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day. Grady Booch first proposed the term CI in his 1991 method, although he did not advocate integrating several times a day. Extreme programming (XP) adopted the concept of CI and did advocate integrating more than once per day – perhaps as many as tens of times per day.

## REST:
#### Representational state transfer (REST) is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful. Such a Web service must provide its Web resources in a textual representation and allow them to be read and modified with a stateless protocol and a predefined set of operations. This approach allows interoperability between the computer systems on the Internet that provide these services. REST is an alternative to, for example, SOAP as way to access a Web service.
from (Wikipedia)

## Data Model:
#### is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.The term data model can refer to two distinct but closely related concepts.
