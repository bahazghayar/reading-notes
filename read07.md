# HTTP
*(HyperText Transfer Protocol)* 
### The communications protocol used to connect to Web servers on the Internet or on a local network (intranet). The primary function of HTTP is to establish a connection with the server and send HTML pages back to the user's browser. It is also used to download data from the server either to the browser or to any requesting application that uses HTTP.   (from www.pcmag.com)

# API 

**Application programming interface**:is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made, how to make them, the data formats that should be used, the conventions to follow, etc. It can also provide extension mechanisms so that users can extend existing functionality in various ways and to varying degrees. An API can be entirely custom, specific to a component, or designed based on an industry-standard to ensure interoperability. Through information hiding, APIs enable modular programming, allowing users to use the interface independently of the implementation. (from wikipedia)
