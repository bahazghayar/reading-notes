You can control the version of any file by version Control System, for local version control your hard disk needs to have one database to store the file's changes, but centralized version control made it easier for programmers and administrators by storing all changes and file versions, but nothing is perfect right?. 
Distributed version control (DVCS) solved a big problem by allowing clients to create mirrored repositories ( data backups ). 

Git is a DVCS for storing the changes of your project version, and it will detect the file's corruption or loss. 
Files in Git can be in three states: 1-committed 2- modified 3- staged.

You can download Git on Mac, Linux, and Microsoft, don't forget to perform some customization steps after installing, like configuration of variables and identity settings, and you always can get help by accessing the manual, then learn how to set up a git repository such as importing and cloning, after that you need to understand the workflow.
