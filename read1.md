### In my definition Markdown is what will make your Dopamine ( Hormone of happiness ) get higher and higher because it makes your life easier and more beautiful with writing styles on the web.

### You can use headers, emphasis, ordered and unordered lists, images, and many more on GitHub or your own text files.

### Also, there is something called GitHub flavored markdown, you can say it's like Nutella, you will enjoy dealing with it and it will make you happy, as an example, syntax highlighting, task lists, tables, and many more. 

### On GitHub you can build a lot of great things and you can share them with the whole world. 

- Three examples of basic writing and formatting syntax:
     1. Heading
                # Hello
     2. Styling text
               Bold: **How are you?**
               Strikethrough: ~~This was mistaken text~~
     3. Paragraphs
                create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line.
