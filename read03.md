# **Templating with Mustache**

**Javascript Templating**: it refers to the client-side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language. This approach became popular thanks to JavaScript's increased use, its increase in client processing capabilities, and the trend to outsource computations to the client's web browser. *(from Wikipedia)*

<br>

## JavaScript templating libraries:
* Mustache.js *(logic-less template syntax)*
* AngularJS
* Backbone.js 
* Ember.js
* Handlebars.js 
* Vue.js

<br>

### You can use Mustache with several things such as HTML, config files, source code and so on. 
### There are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Only tags and some of them are replaced with a value or a series of values. 

<br>

#### Example: 
              Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });
               // returns: Hello, Sherlynn

<br>

You can use *mustache* with *node* and *express* by using **mustache express**.
