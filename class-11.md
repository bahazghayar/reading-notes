# ***Images***
<br>

When you have a **great website** you need to *present* it in a *perfect way*, in order to do so, you should **control** the **size** and **alignment** of your images using CSS by controlling the **width** and the **height** of the images. And, you can **align** the images *horizontally and vertically*.

<br>

#### Example: 
              img.large {
                  width: 500px;
                  height: 500px;
                }

 <br>

You can put a **background image** behind any element on the page, it can appear once or it can be repeated across the box.

<br>

#### Example: 
               p {
                  background-image: url("images/pattern.gif");
                  }

<br>

If you want to **reduce** the *number of images* your browser has to load, you can **create image sprites**.
