# What Is Node and When Should I Use It?

## Node.js 

#### Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the Chrome V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scriptingâ€”running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts. (from wikipedia)

#### Though .js is the standard filename extension for JavaScript code, the name "Node.js" doesn't refer to a particular file in this context and is merely the name of the product. Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations, as well as for real-time Web applications (e.g., real-time communication programs and browser games). (from wikipedia)

#### The Node.js distributed development project was previously governed by the Node.js Foundation, and has now merged with the JS Foundation to form the OpenJS Foundation, which is facilitated by the Linux Foundation's Collaborative Projects program. (from wikipedia)

# V8 

#### V8 is the JavaScript execution engine which was initially built for Google Chrome. It was then open-sourced by Google in 2008. Written in C++, V8 compiles JavaScript source code to native machine code at runtime. As of 2016, it also includes Ignition, a bytecode interpreter. (from wikipedia)

### You can check if node.js is installed on your device and the version by typing this command  `node -v` . 

## npm
### the JavaScript Package Manager
#### You can check which version you have installed on your device by typing `npm -v`.

## What Is Node.js Used For?
### mainly To run javaScript on the server, you can install various build tools via npm and run them via Node.js to automate the process of developing a modern javaScript Application.

#### But you can use it as a scripting language, or to write your own command line tool, and you can use it to build cross-platform desktop apps and even to create your own robots.
