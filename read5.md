# **Introducing CSS ( Cascading style sheets )**

### We use CSS to make our website more attractive by controlling the design of HTML elements, so you need to learn CSS features to design the texts, images, backgrounds, and so on. 

### Each part of your page will be a separate box, and you can control the design of each one of them. 

## CSS rule: 
### * Selector: indicates which element the rule applies to. 
### * Declaration: indicates how the element should be styled

## p { 
## font-family: Arial;} 

### And there are many types of selectors you can use at different elements. 

# **Color**

### You can bring your pages to life by using colors, it allows you to specify the color of backgrounds and the text. 

## Three ways to specify colors: 
### 1. RGB values 
### 2. HEX codes 
### 3. Color names 

### Make sure that there is enough contrast between backgrounds and the text colors.
