I think it depends on the coding language to choose the best text editor, some languages may be better to use on a specific text editor because of the features, for example, It's better to use visual studio for C++.
Maybe you love a specific text editor but it hasn't some features you really need to use.
A text editor is a software for coding You can install your favorite text editor on your device or open it on your browser, and the main difference between text editors is the features, it's all about the features to choose your favorite text editor, after all, you need to make your life easier with coding.
Each system comes with its text editor, also each one has different features.
I think we can say the text editor is like an architecture engineer or a designer who design what we need and the IDE is like a civil engineer who implements what we need.
The command line is like getting deep inside your computer, it looks difficult but trust me its not, give yourself some time to get used to it. 

You can use these commands : 
   pwd : to show directory 
   ls : to show the items in the folder ( but not the hidden ones)
   ls -a : to show the items in the folder including the hidden files 
   mkdir : to make a directory
   cd : to change directory 
   touch : to make a new file inside the directory 
   cd .. : to get back to the parent directory 

Don't forget to move correctly in the system, it all depends on this thing. 
So you need to know that the relative path is our current location and the absolute path is the location of the root of the file system. 
Also, extensions and what it means is very important to know the type of the file, but Linux works without extensions.
