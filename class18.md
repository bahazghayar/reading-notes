# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

#### Review, Research, and Discussion

* Whatâ€™s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
FIFO queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by message consumers.

* How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
When having an event in the client side to emit what received from the server.

* What classic design pattern is best represented by event driven programming?
The observer-pattern

* How do you test an event driven system?
write unit tests, service tests, and end-to-end tests. In each of these cases, your System Under Test (SUT, what is actually being tested) comprises a different part of your application.
Unit tests are the most basic tests you will write. The SUT in this case is typically an individual class.
Service tests, as the name suggests, treat the entire service as the SUT, and increasingly, in microservice architectures this is where the bulk of automated testing occurs.

#### Terms

Serverless Functions: are single-purpose, programmatic functions that are hosted on managed infrastructure. These functions, which are invoked through the Internet, are hosted and maintained by cloud computing companies.

Cloud Storage: is a model of computer data storage in which the digital data is stored in logical pools, said to be on "the cloud". The physical storage spans multiple servers (sometimes in multiple locations), and the physical environment is typically owned and managed by a hosting company. These cloud storage providers are responsible for keeping the data available and accessible, and the physical environment protected and running. People and organizations buy or lease storage capacity from the providers to store user, organization, or application data.

CDN: Content Delivery Network is a geographically distributed group of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of Internet content. A CDN allows for the fast transfer of data needed for loading Internet content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.

### Preparation Materials

Amazon API Gateway is a managed service that allows developers to define the HTTP endpoints of a REST API or a WebSocket API and connect those endpoints with the corresponding backend business logic. It also handles authentication, access control, monitoring, and tracing of API requests.

Many Serverless applications use Amazon API Gateway, which conveniently replaces the API servers with a managed serverless solution.

API Types:
* RESTful APIs
* WEBSOCKET APIs

DynamoDB is a hosted NoSQL database offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It offers:
reliable performance even as it scales;
a managed experience, so you won't be SSH-ing into servers to upgrade the crypto libraries;
a small, simple API allowing for simple key-value access as well as more advanced query patterns.

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. DynamoDB can handle more than 10 trillion requests per day and can support peaks of more than 20 million requests per second.

Dynamoose is a modeling tool for Amazon's DynamoDB. Dynamoose is heavily inspired by Mongoose, which means if you are coming from Mongoose the syntax will be very familar.
