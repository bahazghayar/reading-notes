# **Deep Inside Computers**

computers are everywhere, on your desk, in your pocket, on your hand, and many more different places so have you ever asked yourself how do computers work? 

### Inventors realized that computers had to make four tasks: 
1. input 
2. Storage
3. Processing 
4. Output 

All different inputs give a computer an information, which is then stored in memory, then the processor deals with that information then get it back to memory, then the results will be ready to be output.

**Bit:** a computer can store a small piece of information.
More bits means more complex information which means more ones and zeros *(**binary number system**)*
All types of information like text, images, and sounds can be represented by numbers.
**So ones and zeros and electrical signals in circuits are behind everything that happens in computers.**

### But why computer processers are so fast? 
**because it's just millions of circuits.**
