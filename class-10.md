# Error Handling & Debugging

 <br>

#### **Errors** will happen when you write a code, and you need to deal with those errors by ***handling*** or ***debugging***, it's the process of finding errors, It involves a *process of deduction*. 

<br>

#### Of course, you need to understand the order of execution context, some tasks can't complete until another statements have been run, the console will help you to find the error area in your code in order to find the exact error in that area. 

<br>

#### Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity: 
1. #### Prepare.
2. #### Execute. 

<br>

#### Types of ***errors***:  *each one creates its own error object*. 
* #### Syntax error.
* #### Reference error.
* #### Eval Error.
* #### URI error.
* #### Type error.
* #### Range error.
