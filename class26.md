# Component Based UI

### Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
* Angular
* Vue.js
* Ember.js
* Meteor
* Mithril

2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
The technical difference between a framework and library lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library, you are in charge of the flow of the application. You are choosing when and where to call the library. When you use a framework, the framework is in charge of the flow.

### Terms

**Rendering**: 1. Render refers to taking a computer image or file and converting it into another format or applying a modification, like shading or shadows. 2. When referring to 3D animation, render refers making an image appear as a 3D or taking a series of images and making them animated

**Templates**: when used in the context of word processing software, refers to a sample document that has already some details in place; those can (that is added/completed, removed or changed, differently from a fill-in-the-blank of the approach as in a form) either by hand or through an automated iterative process, such as with a software assistant 

**State**: In information technology and computer science, a system is described as stateful if it is designed to remember preceding events or user interactions; the remembered information is called the state of the system.

### Preparation Materials

**React**: (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

Example:

                ReactDOM.render(
                <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
                document.getElementById('root')
                );

**JSX**: and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.

JSX produces React “elements”.
